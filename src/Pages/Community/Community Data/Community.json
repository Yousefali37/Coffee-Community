I use 1:15 coffee to water ratio and steep for exactly 4 minutes. \n Here's my step-by-step process: \n 1- Grind fresh beans to a coarse consistency Heat water to 200°F (93°C) \n 2- Add ground coffee to the French press Pour a small amount of water to bloom the coffee for 30 seconds \n 3- Add the remaining water and place the lid on with the plunger pulled up Wait exactly 4 minutes \n 4- Slowly press the plunger down Pour immediately into your cup to prevent over-extraction \n I've found this method consistently produces a full-bodied cup with rich flavors and minimal bitterness. The key factors are water temperature, grind consistency, and steep time. What French press techniques have worked well for you?",
